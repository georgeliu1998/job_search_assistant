# Design Decisions

[‚Üê Back to Documentation](../README.md)

This section documents the key design decisions, architectural choices, and implementation rationale for the Job Search Assistant project.

## Overview

The Job Search Assistant is built with a focus on modularity, extensibility, and maintainability. This section explains the "why" behind our architectural choices and how different components work together.

## Design Documents

### [Configuration Management](configuration.md)
Explains the TOML-based configuration system, environment-specific overrides, and how configuration is loaded and validated throughout the application.

### [Agent Infrastructure](agent-infrastructure.md)
Details the LangGraph-based agent framework, including the separation of concerns between agents, tools, and workflows, and how this enables complex AI-powered processes.

### [Job Evaluation Design](job-evaluation-design.md)
Describes why job evaluation is implemented as a workflow rather than a simple agent, and how this design supports future enhancements.

### [Observability & Tracing](observability-tracing.md)
Explains the context-aware Langfuse tracing system, including how to eliminate duplicate traces and monitor AI workflows effectively.

### [LLM Factory Pattern](llm-factory-pattern.md)
Documents the factory pattern implementation for multi-provider LLM support, including provider registration mechanisms, usage patterns, and extension strategies.

## Design Principles

Our design decisions are guided by these principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are loosely coupled and can be developed/tested independently
2. **Extensibility**: New features can be added without major refactoring
3. **Observability**: Built-in monitoring and logging for debugging and optimization
4. **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior is controlled through configuration rather than code changes
5. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of failures with meaningful error messages
